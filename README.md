# RISCOSStuff
This is a place to share small programs I write.  You know those that do one or two simple things.  Some toys, some utilities, whatever else I whip up out of need or want.

These will from here on out be little useless and useful BASIC and Assembly Language programs.  They will be put inside of RISC OS ARCFS archives for distribution to preserve the filetypes.

All BASIC Programs will be in BBC BASIC V.  All Assembly Programs will have there source in BASIC using the builtin BBC BASIC assembler (simplifies the issue of what assembler to use).

Nothing will be allocated, I am an American, and we are not known for allocating applications, modules or similar.  This is the way it has always been, no reason to change now.
