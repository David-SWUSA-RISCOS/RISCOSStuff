# RISCOSStuff
This is a place to share small programs I write.  You know those that do one or two simple things.  Some toys, some utilities, whatever else I whip up out of need or want.

If you have use for anything here, go for it.

I am a member of the South West USA RISC OS Users Group since 1992.

## Important
These Programs are for RISC OS.

Any BASIC code is in tokenized form not text.
