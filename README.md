# RISCOSStuff
This is a place to share small programs I write.  You know those that do one or two simple things.  Some toys, some utilities, whatever else I whip up out of need or want.

If you have use for anything here, go for it.

Everything in this repo is MIT licensed.

## Important
These Programs are for RISC OS.

Any BASIC code is in tokenized form not text.
