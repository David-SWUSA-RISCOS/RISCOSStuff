# RISCOSStuff
This is a place to share small programs I write.  You know those that do one or two simple things.  Some toys, some utilities, whatever else I whip up out of need or want.

These will from here on out be little useless and useful BASIC and Assembly Language programs.  They will be put inside of RISC OS ARCFS archives for distribution to preserve the filetypes.

All BASIC Programs will be in BBC BASIC V.  All Assembly Programs will have there source in BASIC using the builtin BBC BASIC assembler (simplifies the issue of what assembler to use).

Nothing will be allocated, I am an American, and we are not known for allocating applications, modules or similar.  This is the way it has always been, no reason to change now.

## Without WIMP:

It is interesting when you realize some things.  One thing I recently realized is that the programs I enjoy the most in RISC OS are those that do not use the WIMP at all.   I have began to think about this for other Operating Systems I like as well, and it is that all my most liked and used are those that do not take advantage of a Windowing System.

This goes for all kinds of programs, including some that by nature use a mouse (like Graphical Web Browsers or Paint Programs), it is the full screen graphical programs, and other command line driven software that holds me on any OS.

Thanks to my love of RISC OS I have realized what other Operating Systems I really still enjoy, including some that have had minimal use as late do to falling for the it's outdated wrong mindset.  These OS's are the kinds of OS that will drive us forward to long term computing.

I do still enjoy playing around in Windowing Systems for some things, though only when it is sensible.

## Going very Long Term Desktop Computer usage.

This and my [8-bit and Macro Assembler Stuff](https://github.com/David-SWUSA-RISCOS/MacStuffA/) repos are my ongoing focus. The goal is to enjoy coding, and promote the design and use of extreme long term usage Desktop Computers (Desktop Systems designed to be used for 5 decades or more without replacement, both software and hardware). We have had Desktop Personal Computers for about 50 years now, so we now are in a place to look at what has been reliable for these things and what has not been so reliable.

Long term computing is needed moving forward. We need to reduce the energy and material usage of replacing our computing devices too often, we need to reduce the energy usage of sending them through tech recyclers after we are done with them. Ideally we should have computers that will be in continous use for as long as possible. This also means STOP pushing for people to use more powerful CPU's when it is not needed (like internet based applications, video viewing/editing, 3D-Modeling). Many tasks can be done easily and well in real time with a lot lower end HW that is pushed, if the programmers give thought to these things, and use file formats that do not need to strain the CPU or other processors in our computers.

While I focus on the issue of long term computing from the view of Desktop Computing (including laptops), the issue also applies to other computing applications. For long term computing we also need to prolong the life of handheld computers ('Smart' Cell Phones, Digital Music players, GPS mapping systems, etc), as well as embeded devices (thermastats, lighting control systems, engine control and monitoring systems, etc). These are areas that others are looking into as well. My area is primarily the Desktop Comuting view of things.
