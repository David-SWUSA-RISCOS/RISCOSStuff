# RISCOSStuff
This is a place to share small programs I write.  You know those that do one or two simple things.  Some toys, some utilities, whatever else I whip up out of need or want.

If you have use for anything here, go for it.

Everything in this repo is MIT licensed.

## Important
These Programs are for RISC OS.

Any BASIC code is in tokenized form not text.

## Planned Software:

I will in the nearish future be releasing what I have completed, or at least got to a usable point for RISC OS.  It is likely that I will after 34 years be moving away from RISC OS usage and back toward Classic Macintosh System Software, Amiga OS, and Apple IIgs GS/OS usage.
