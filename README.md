# RISCOSStuff
This is a place to share small programs I write.  You know those that do one or two simple things.  Some toys, some utilities, whatever else I whip up out of need or want.

These will from here on out be little useless and useful BASIC and Assembly Language programs.  They will be put inside of RISC OS ARCFS archives for distribution to preserve the filetypes.

All BASIC Programs will be in BBC BASIC V.  All Assembly Programs will have there source in BASIC using the builtin BBC BASIC assembler (simplifies the issue of what assembler to use).

Nothing will be allocated, I am an American, and we are not known for allocating applications, modules or similar.  This is the way it has always been, no reason to change now.

## Without WIMP:

It is interesting when you realize some things.  One thing I recently realized is that the programs I enjoy the most in RISC OS are those that do not use the WIMP at all.   I have began to think about this for other Operating Systems I like as well, and it is that all my most liked and used are those that do not take advantage of a Windowing System.

This goes for all kinds of programs, including some that by nature use a mouse (like Graphical Web Browsers or Paint Programs), it is the full screen graphical programs, and other command line driven software that holds me on any OS.

Thanks to my love of RISC OS I have realized what other Operating Systems I really still enjoy, including some that have had minimal use as late do to falling for the it's outdated wrong mindset.  These OS's are the kinds of OS that will drive us forward to long term computing.
