These are just some graphical toys in RISC OS BBC BASIC V.  Just so that there is something in the repo.

The !help, readme/txt and license files is of type text.
The other files need to be typed to BASIC in RISC OS.

The file GfxToys is an ArcFS archive.

Going to be uploading an arcfs archive to preserve filetypes.  Also changing the license information in each file.

In order to extract the archive on RISC OS, make sure you have a copy of [ArcFS](https://armclub.org.uk/products/arcfs/), set the filetype of the downloaded file to **3FB** and open the archive as normal.
