These programs are simple little toy graphics written either in showing
someone how to do something, or just for the fun of it.  Either way I hope
you either learn a little from these or have some fun with them.

Included are:
* Program illistrating how to implement Midpoint Circle Algorithm.
* SinHat.
* A wheel of all points connected.
* A Mandelbrot.
* And one anoying animation with sound.

As I add comments, and or clean up some of the code, others will be added.
